# WendyVerse
Wendy the Android or Robot python script adventure file

    print("Program 7: Wendy")
    print("Hello, I am Wendy!")
    print("The Adventure begins in WendyVerse .....")
    print("")
    print("")
    go=input("Press any key to continue")
    
This is a script for my Wendy robot adventure.
Obviously it is a game and a work in progress :)
It is also a splitoff from kstart2025.py
